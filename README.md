## Hi, I'm Hitik!

I am pursuing my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Chandigarh University.<br>
I enjoy coding as well as designing.
Being consistent to my passion I've developed various web/mobile applications. I always push myself for exploring new and interesting things. <br>
If not coding or designing you'll find me in the Gym or maybe in playground.. <br>
